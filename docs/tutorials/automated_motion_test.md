# Automated Motion Testing

**System identification and response recording made easy.**

The **MotionServer** is a specialized component designed for robot calibration and system identification. It performs two critical tasks:

1. **Automated Testing:** It sends open-loop reference commands (e.g., steps, circles) to the robot.
2. **Data Recording:** It records the robot's actual response (Odometry) versus the sent command (`cmd_vel`) to a CSV file.

This data is essential for tuning controllers, verifying kinematic constraints, or training machine learning models.

## The Recipe

Below is a complete recipe to launch a simulation (or real robot), triggering the Motion Server via an event.

**Create a file named `motion_test.py`:**

```python
import numpy as np
import os
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory

# Kompass Imports
from kompass.robot import (
    AngularCtrlLimits, LinearCtrlLimits, RobotGeometry, RobotType, RobotConfig, RobotFrames
)
from kompass.components import (
    DriveManager, DriveManagerConfig, MapServer, MapServerConfig,
    TopicsKeys, MotionServer, MotionServerConfig
)
from kompass.ros import Topic, Launcher

def run_motion_test():
    kompass_sim_dir = get_package_share_directory(package_name="kompass_sim")

    # 1. Robot Configuration
    # Define physical limits (Crucial for the MotionServer to generate valid test commands)
    my_robot = RobotConfig(
        model_type=RobotType.DIFFERENTIAL_DRIVE,
        geometry_type=RobotGeometry.Type.CYLINDER,
        geometry_params=np.array([0.1, 0.3]),
        ctrl_vx_limits=LinearCtrlLimits(max_vel=0.4, max_acc=1.5, max_decel=2.5),
        ctrl_omega_limits=AngularCtrlLimits(max_vel=0.4, max_acc=2.0, max_decel=2.0, max_steer=np.pi / 3),
    )

    # 2. Configure Motion Server
    # We configure it to run "Circle Tests" for 10 seconds per test
    motion_config = MotionServerConfig(
        test_period=10.0,
        run_circle_test=True,
        run_step_test=False,
        tests_folder=os.path.expanduser("~/.kompass/tests") # Where to save CSVs
    )

    motion_server = MotionServer(component_name="motion_server", config=motion_config)
    motion_server.run_type = "Event" # Wait for a trigger to start

    # 3. Drive Manager
    # Acts as the safety layer between MotionServer and the Hardware
    driver = DriveManager(
        component_name="drive_manager",
        config=DriveManagerConfig(critical_zone_distance=0.05)
    )

    # Handle ROS 2 Distribution message types
    cmd_msg_type = "TwistStamped" if os.environ.get("ROS_DISTRO") in ["rolling", "jazzy"] else "Twist"

    # 4. Wiring
    # The Driver publishes the final hardware command
    cmd_topic = Topic(name="/cmd_vel", msg_type=cmd_msg_type)
    driver.outputs(robot_command=cmd_topic)

    # The MotionServer listens to that SAME topic to record what was actually sent
    motion_server.inputs(command=cmd_topic)

    # 5. Context (Map Server)
    map_server = MapServer(
        component_name="global_map_server",
        config=MapServerConfig(
            map_file_path=os.path.join(kompass_sim_dir, "maps", "turtlebot3_webots.yaml"),
            grid_resolution=0.5
        )
    )

    # 6. Launch
    launcher = Launcher()
    launcher.kompass(components=[map_server, driver, motion_server], multiprocessing=True)

    # Link Odometry (The response we want to record)
    odom_topic = Topic(name="/odometry/filtered", msg_type="Odometry")
    launcher.inputs(location=odom_topic)

    launcher.robot = my_robot
    launcher.frames = RobotFrames(world="map", odom="map", scan="LDS-01")

    # 7. Enable UI
    # We expose the RUN_TESTS input so we can trigger it from the browser
    launcher.enable_ui(
        inputs=[motion_server.get_in_topic(TopicsKeys.RUN_TESTS)],
        outputs=[map_server.get_out_topic(TopicsKeys.GLOBAL_MAP), odom_topic]
    )

    launcher.bringup()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_motion_test()

```

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Launch the Stack

Run the script you just created. Ensure your simulator (e.g., Webots or Gazebo) is running first.

```bash
python3 motion_test.py

```

### 2. Open the UI

Open your browser to the local UI URL (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:5001`). You will see the map and the robot.

### 3. Trigger the Test

In the **Inputs** panel on the UI, you will see a switch or button for `run_tests`.

* Toggle it to **True** and click **send**.

```{figure} ../_static/images/turtlebot3_run_tests.png
:alt: Motion test UI
:align: center
:width: 80%

```

### 4. Watch the Robot

The robot will immediately execute the configured test pattern (e.g., driving in circles).

1. **Forward Circle:** Max Velocity / 2
2. **Inverse Circle:** Negative Velocity
3. **Backward Circle**

The robot will automatically stop after the sequence is complete.

## Analyzing the Data

Once the tests are finished, check the folder configured in `tests_folder` (in the recipe above: `~/.kompass/tests`).

You will find CSV files named by the test type (e.g., `circle_forward.csv`).

**CSV Structure:**
| timestamp | x | y | yaw | cmd_vx | cmd_vy | cmd_omega |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 16234.12 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.2 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

You can plot these columns to compare the `cmd_vx` (Reference) vs the derivative of `x` (Response) to calculate your system's step response and latency.

---

## Configuration Options

You can customize the testing behavior via `MotionServerConfig`:

* **`test_period`** *(float, default=10.0)*: Duration of each individual test step in seconds.
* **`run_step_test`** *(bool, default=False)*: Runs linear step inputs (forward/backward straight lines).
* **`run_circle_test`** *(bool, default=True)*: Runs combined linear and angular velocity commands.
* **`tests_folder`** *(str)*: Absolute path where CSV files will be saved.

:::{admonition} Wiring Tip
:class: tip
The **MotionServer** generates commands, but usually sends them to the **DriveManager** first for safety checks. However, for accurate recording, the MotionServer should listen to the **output** of the DriveManager (`cmd_vel`) as its input. This ensures you record exactly what was sent to the motors, including any safety overrides.
