# Tutorials Overview

The following tutorials provide a hands-on guide to help you get started with Kompass navigation framework. These tutorials are designed to walk you through real-world examples that showcase core features like event-driven control, image-based tracking, and more.

Whether you're just getting started or looking to build more advanced robotic behavior, these examples provide a strong foundation.

## Point Navigation: Step-by-Step Tutorial

Learn how to set up and run basic point-to-point navigation using Kompass. This tutorial walks you through defining a goal, launching the navigation stack, and observing robot behavior in simulation (or on hardware).

## Using Events/Actions in Your Application

Discover how Kompass handles dynamic decision-making using its **event driven** system. This tutorial explains how to define event-action pairs. We we will extend our previous system (Point Navigation) by adding a clicked point event and a Planner action.

## Following a Moving Target using RGB Image

Implement a visual servoing pipeline to follow a moving target using an RGB camera. You'll learn how to integrate vision-based tracking into your navigation logic.

<!-- ## Following a Moving Target using Depth

Extend the previous example using **depth sensing** to gain more robust tracking.
