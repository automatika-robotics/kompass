# Quick Start

Here we provide a quick recipe to get started with Kompass. The recipe is a single python script to build a point navigation system. We will test the recipe in simulation. Lets first see how we can launch the simulation and run the recipe and then we will go through it step by step.

## Launch the simulation

For an easy start with Kompass we created a separate simulation package ([kompass_sim](https://github.com/automatika-robotics/kompass-sim)) with ready-to-launch examples created to test 2D navigation using few popular robot simulators. In this example we will use a simulation of the [Turtlebot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/#notices) robot in [Webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2) simulator.

- To launch the simulation, start by cloning and building `kompass_sim` from source, see the instructions [here](https://github.com/automatika-robotics/kompass-sim/blob/main/README.md)

- Now you can launch the simulation by simply running:

```shell
ros2 launch kompass_sim webots_turtlebot3.launch.py
```

This will start webots simulator, Rviz and the robot localization and map server:

## Run the recipe


- Open a new terminal and launch our recipe:

```shell
ros2 run kompass turtlebot3_test
```

Now, we'll break the recipe down step by step ðŸ‘‡

```{include} point_navigation.md
