# Kompass

Kompass is a framework for building robust and comprehensive event-driven navigation stacks using an easy-to-use and intuitive Python API. Kompass is built to be customizable, extendable and hardware-agnostic. It aims to implement the most cutting edge algorithms for all parts of the navigation stack. And most importantly, it allows users to create very sophisticated navigation capabilities for autonomous mobile robots, within a single python script.

Kompass is divided into several interacting components each responsible for one of the navigation subtasks:

Each of the previous components runs as a ROS2 lifecycle node and communicates with the other components using ROS2 topics, services or action servers:
