```{note}
Topic for _Control Command_ is both in MotionServer inputs and outputs:
- The output is used when running automated testing (i.e. sending the commands directly from the MotionServer).
- The input is used to purly record motion and control from external sources (example: recording output from Controller).
- Different command topics can be configured for the input and the output. For example: to test the DriveManager, the control command from MotionServer output can be sent to the DriveManager, then the DriveManager output can be configured as the MotionServer input for recording.
