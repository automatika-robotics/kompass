# üß© Design Concepts

Kompass is designed using [Sugarcoatüç¨](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat). A [Component](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/component.html) is the main execution unit in Kompass, each component is configured with [Inputs/Outputs](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/topics.html) and [Fallback](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/fallbacks.html) behaviors. Additionally, each component updates its own [Health Status](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/status.html). Components can be handled and reconfigured dynamically at runtime using [Events](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/events.html) and [Actions](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/actions.html). Events, Actions and Components are passed to the [Launcher](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/launcher.html) which runs the set of components as using multi-threaded or multi-process execution. The Launcher also uses an internal [Monitor](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/sugarcoat/design/monitor.html) to keep track of the components and monitor events.
