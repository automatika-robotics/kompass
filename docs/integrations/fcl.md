# FCL (Flexible Collision Library)

**High-speed geometric collision detection.**


[FCL](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) is a generic library for performing proximity and collision queries on geometric models.

Kompass leverages FCL to perform precise collision checks between the robot's kinematic model and both static (map) and dynamic (sensor) obstacles during path planning and control.
