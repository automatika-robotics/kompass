# FCL (Flexible Collisions Library)

[FCL](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) is generic library for geometric collision detection. Kompass provides FCL wrappers to detect collisions between the robot and static/dynamic obstacles during the navigation:
- C++ wrapper in [kompass_cpp](https://github.com/automatika-robotics/kompass-core/tree/main/src/kompass_cpp)
- Python wrapper in [kompass_core](https://github.com/automatika-robotics/kompass-core/tree/main/src/kompass_core)
