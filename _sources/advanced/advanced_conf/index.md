# üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configurations


Kompass provides advanced fine-tuning options for developers who need more control over how components behave, connect, and communicate. Whether you're working with custom hardware, distributed systems, or tight real-time loops, this section helps you go beyond the defaults.

- **[Configuring Components Inputs and Outputs](topics.md)**: See how to define input/output topics for Kompass components, and how to use Inputs/Outputs in your custom components


- **[Topics QoS Configuration](qos.md)**: See how to configure **Quality of Service (QoS)** settings for inputs/outputs in Kompass, so you can match communication behavior to your system's needs.
